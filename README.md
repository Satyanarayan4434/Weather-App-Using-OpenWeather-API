# Weather-App-Using-OpenWeather-API

Introduction : 
This is a basic weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for a given city. The app is built with Tailwind CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.

Usage : 
To use the app, simply enter a city name in the search bar and press Enter. The app will then fetch the weather data for that city and display it on the screen.

Features :
The app currently supports the following features:
Get the current weather conditions for a given city
Get the forecast for a given city

Future Plans:
I plan to add the following features to the app in the future:

Ability to save favorite cities
Ability to get weather alerts
Ability to share weather information with others
Feedback
I would love to hear your feedback on the app. Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub or send me an email.

Thank you
